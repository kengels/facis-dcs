# One authored SLA travels the whole federation path.
#
# The artefact is features/fixtures/sla_hosting_template.jsonld — a Managed
# Kubernetes Hosting SLA between Nordwind Cloud Services GmbH (Provider, on
# instance A) and Hansa Logistics AG (Customer, on instance B). It declares 9
# ODRL 2.2 rules over 13 contract fields across 7 sections, including a nested
# logical constraint tree, a duty whose non-fulfilment triggers a consequence,
# and 9 negotiated boundaries — right operands that reference a contract field
# instead of a literal, which is what makes a boundary negotiable at all.
#
# What these scenarios measure is not that a file copied. It is that instance
# A's AUTHORED ENFORCEMENT SEMANTICS crossed the Federated Catalogue intact and
# then BOUND instance B, which never saw instance A's code: the same rules, the
# same constraint tree, the same consequence, the same boundaries — and the
# same refusal when a negotiated value falls outside them.
#
# The @two-instance scenarios need a second real DCS process and
# BDD_DCS_BASE_URL_A/_B rather than the single-instance BDD_DCS_BASE_URL
# (dev-stack2.sh locally, the dcs-a/dcs-b Helm releases in CI). Instance B
# consumes instance A's Federated Catalogue rather than standing up its own
# (deployment/helm/values.bdd2.yml), which is precisely the A -> catalogue -> B
# path scenario 1 exercises.
#
# Every structural number below is asserted against BOTH copies and against the
# authored template; the step definitions count, they do not assume. A fixture
# that gains a rule therefore shows up as a diff in this file.

Feature: SLA contract federation — a template's enforcement semantics bind the instance that imported it

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Federating the template itself.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @two-instance @DCS-IR-SI-01 @UC-02
  Scenario: Instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue and instance B finds it
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the SLA hosting template is authored and registered on instance A
    When instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue
    And instance B searches the Federated Catalogue for the SLA template
    Then the catalogue search result on instance B includes the SLA template
    And the catalogued SLA entry carries the ODRL Offer and the sh:shapesGraph pin

  # An import mints a brand-new local DID on instance B and lands it in Draft
  # (backend/internal/templaterepository/command/register.go): the catalogue
  # hands over content, never authority — B's own repository governs what B
  # offers its customers. What must NOT change in transit is the ODRL.
  @two-instance @DCS-IR-SI-01 @DCS-FR-TR-01
  Scenario: Instance B registers the catalogued SLA template into its own repository
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the SLA hosting template is authored and registered on instance A
    And instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue
    When instance B registers the catalogued SLA template into its own repository
    Then the imported SLA template on instance B is in "Draft" status
    And the imported SLA template declares 2 permissions, 3 prohibitions and 4 obligations
    And the imported SLA template carries a logical constraint tree of depth 3
    And the imported SLA template carries 1 duty consequence
    And the imported SLA template carries 9 field-bound right operands
    And the imported SLA template pins the same sh:shapesGraph name and version as instance A's

  @two-instance @DCS-FR-TR-01 @UC-02
  Scenario: Instance B drives the imported SLA template through its own approval and registers it
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the SLA hosting template is authored and registered on instance A
    And instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue
    And instance B registers the catalogued SLA template into its own repository
    When instance B drives the imported SLA template through its own approval and registers it
    Then the imported SLA template on instance B is in "Registered" status

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Instantiating and offering the contract. Instance B is the originator
  # here — the customer draws the agreement from the template it imported and
  # offers it back to the provider that published it.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @two-instance @DCS-FR-CWE-03 @DCS-NFR-SQ-06
  Scenario: Instance B instantiates the SLA, fills every field, and offers it to instance A
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the SLA hosting template is authored and registered on instance A
    And instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue
    And instance B registers the catalogued SLA template into its own repository
    And instance B drives the imported SLA template through its own approval and registers it
    And instance B instantiates an SLA contract from its imported template with instance A as counterparty
    # A contract drawn from an imported template declares the upstream author's
    # shape library beside the canonical DCS graph. Every consequential
    # transition below is gated on an immutable snapshot built from that
    # declaration and the pinned bundle, so the two have to agree before the
    # offer is even attempted.
    Then the SLA contract on instance B pins an effective bundle covering every shapes graph it declares
    When instance B fills every open field of the SLA contract
    Then all 13 contract fields of the SLA contract carry a value on instance B
    And the SLA contract on instance B pins an effective bundle covering every shapes graph it declares
    When instance B offers the SLA contract to instance A
    Then the SLA contract is in state OFFERED on instance B
    And the SLA contract appears on instance A in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    And instance A's copy of the SLA contract carries the identical ODRL Offer
    # The copy that crossed carries instance B's pin under instance B's
    # hostname; instance A gates its own transitions on exactly that document.
    And the SLA contract on instance A pins an effective bundle covering every shapes graph it declares
    # What crossed must be the contract that was offered, not a render of it
    # taken before the fields were filled: the PDF the peer adopts as its copy
    # carries the document (ADR-13), so an offer whose PDF lags its own
    # contract_data would hand instance A a contract with 13 open fields.
    And all 13 contract fields of the SLA contract carry a value on instance A

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # THE LOAD-BEARING SCENARIO.
  #
  # Instance A — the instance that AUTHORED the template — counter-offers a
  # committed availability of 94.0, below the floor its own template sets
  # (odrl:gteq 99.5 on the availability duty). Negotiation is free to move
  # values, so the counter-offer itself is recorded and ships; the floor bites
  # at the approval gate (ValidateContractPolicySatisfaction, approve.go), and
  # it bites on BOTH copies.
  #
  # That is the whole demonstration. The refusal on instance B proves the
  # semantics travelled: B evaluates a constraint it never wrote, over a
  # vocabulary it received through the catalogue, and reaches the same verdict
  # as A. The refusal on instance A proves the floor is not a courtesy the
  # author can waive for itself.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @two-instance @DCS-FR-PACM-03 @DCS-FR-CWE-18 @UC-03-01
  Scenario: A negotiated availability below the template's own floor is refused on both instances
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the SLA hosting template is authored and registered on instance A
    And instance A publishes the SLA template to the Federated Catalogue
    And instance B registers the catalogued SLA template into its own repository
    And instance B drives the imported SLA template through its own approval and registers it
    And instance B instantiates an SLA contract from its imported template with instance A as counterparty
    And instance B fills every open field of the SLA contract
    And instance B offers the SLA contract to instance A
    And the SLA contract appears on instance A in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A counter-offers a committed availability of "94.0" on the SLA contract
    Then the SLA contract shows a committed availability of "94.0" on instance A within a few seconds
    And the SLA contract's ODRL is structurally intact on instance A
    And the SLA contract shows a committed availability of "94.0" on instance B within a few seconds
    And the SLA contract's ODRL is structurally intact on instance B
    When instance A drives its copy of the SLA contract to REVIEWED
    And instance A attempts to approve the SLA contract
    Then the approval on instance A is refused naming the availability constraint
    When instance B drives its copy of the SLA contract to REVIEWED
    And instance B attempts to approve the SLA contract
    Then the approval on instance B is refused naming the availability constraint

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The ping-pong the negotiated boundaries exist for: the template fixes the
  # boundary, the parties haggle the value inside it. A counters 99.9 -> 99.7,
  # B counters back 99.7 -> 99.8, each hop shipping a re-rendered PDF over the
  # DCS-to-DCS exchange (ADR-13). The assertion after every hop is that the
  # POLICY did not move — negotiation moves values, never structure.
  #
  # Both counters stay inside the floor, so both copies settle and approve, and
  # the agreement is then signed on both sides. The renegotiation attempt at
  # the end must fail: once the artefact carries the counterparty's signature a
  # redline would ship the old signed bytes against a moved document
  # (command.ErrAgreementSettled for a copy still in OFFERED/NEGOTIATION, the
  # missing EventNegotiate edge out of SIGNED for one that has signed). That is
  # why every hop above happens BEFORE anyone signs.

  Scenario: The federated SLA is negotiated across instances, reaches SIGNED on both, and seals as an odrl:Agreement

  # The same authored SLA in operation, on one instance and with no Federated
  # Catalogue involved. The parties committed 99.9% availability; the target
  # system measures 98.2% and concludes that this breaches the availability
  # duty, naming that rule's @id as it travelled to it in the deployment
  # envelope (ADR-33) — one term out of the nine this SLA carries, which is
