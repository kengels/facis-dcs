"""BDD steps for the SLA contract federation demonstrator
(features/27_sla_contract_federation).

One authored artefact — features/fixtures/sla_hosting_template.jsonld, a
Managed Kubernetes Hosting SLA between a Provider on instance A and a Customer
on instance B — travels the whole federation path: authored and registered on
A, published to the Federated Catalogue, found and imported by B, approved and
registered under B's OWN workflow, instantiated into a contract, negotiated
back and forth between the two instances, and signed on both.

What the pack measures is that A's AUTHORED ENFORCEMENT SEMANTICS survive that
journey. The ODRL the template declares — its rules, its nested logical
constraint tree, its duty consequence, and its negotiated boundaries (right
operands that reference a contract field rather than a literal) — must arrive
on B byte-equivalent in structure, and must then bind instance B, which never
saw instance A's code, exactly as it binds A. The load-bearing case is the
refusal: a counter-offer of a committed availability below the template's own
`gteq 99.5` floor is refused at the approval gate on BOTH instances.

Fixture coupling
----------------
The fixture is loaded by path and every structural number the scenarios assert
(rule counts per bucket, constraint-tree depth, consequence count, field-bound
right operands, field count) is COMPUTED from it rather than hardcoded here —
the feature file states the expected numbers, and this module only counts. A
fixture change therefore surfaces as a feature-file diff, not as a silent pass.

The only fixture knowledge baked in is _FIELD_FILL_DEFAULTS: a plausible
negotiated value per field, keyed by the field @id's FRAGMENT (the part after
'#'), which survives the rebase contract creation applies to every template
node IRI (validation.rebaseIDText: `<templateID>#field-x` -> `<contractID>
#field-x`). A value the field's own dcs:valueConstraint does not admit is
replaced by one it does, an unknown fragment falls back to a datatype default,
and every fill is checked against both that declared constraint and the
literal ODRL constraints that bind it, so a fixture that grows a field this
table does not know still fails loudly and specifically rather than
mysteriously at the submission gate.

Domain library
--------------
The template declares TWO shapes graphs: the canonical DCS envelope, which
every instance seeds at startup, and `facis-sla-hosting`, the hosting domain —
the asset classes in a kind="shapes" entry and the flat commercial fields in a
kind="ontology" one. That library is published at RUNTIME, never seeded
(features/fixtures/facis-sla-hosting-{shapes,ontology}.ttl), because importing
a vocabulary is exactly the seam a second domain enters DCS through. Nothing
resolves a declared shapes graph until a document is submitted, so an instance
that has not installed it authors and imports the template happily and then
refuses the contract drawn from it — which is why _install_sla_domain_library
runs on every instance this pack touches, before anything is authored on it.

Identity
--------
Most steps authenticate with the suite-shared role tokens. The negotiating
participant on each instance does NOT: /contract/submit's DRAFT/OFFERED branch
requires the submitter to be the contract's own creator (submit.go:118), and
HasOpenNegotiationDecisions excludes only a decision the CALLER itself
authored — so the create, the offer, the counter-offer and the submit that
closes the round have to come from one and the same participant. A BDD identity
is exactly (roles, organization), so each instance gets its own dedicated
organization for that participant, keeping this pack's negotiation rounds out
of the suite-shared role tokens whose state other scenarios depend on. This is
the same reasoning (and the same shape) as
steps/peer_trust/dcs_peer_trust_steps.py's _B_COUNTERPARTY_ORG.

That dedicated organization is also why the create names its parties. Read
authorization matches the caller's organization against the creating one and
against the organizations the document declares under dcs:parties — the create
request's `parties` list (query/contract/querybyid.go CallerMayReadContract).
Instance B is the ORIGINATOR here, so its copy gets no relief from the
received-copy rule that lets instance A's reviewer and approver read theirs,
and its readers are two organizations rather than one: the negotiating
participant above, and the suite-shared one the reviewer, the approver, the
manager and the peer-trust signing steps this pack reuses all present. Naming
both is what a real creator does for every organization entitled to see the
contract.
